Hello, My name is Sasha and I am a student at rs school. Born in Kazakhstan

I graduated from Moscow Mining University MISIS with a degree in mining engineering. I didn't like this profession, but still, I decided to complete my studies. After university, I decided to start learning programming, and Python became the first language to learn, then I accidentally stumbled upon the rs school website and saw that there was free education, and decided to try my luck in front-end development, there were many attempts to enter the course, and because of work, and discipline, I always left almost at the start of the course. But I am prepared for this course.

I'll tell you briefly what I like about this profession: 
1- I like that you can immediately see the result of your code. 
2- The frontend is very diverse, on one project you can make a UX / UI design, then write an animation, and at the end touch the backend . 
3- You can easily change the location of your residence. 
4- And Iâ€™ll say a little base, I like the front end because there is good career growth there, and this is better for me than working in a "Pyaterochka",

I'll tell you a little about my last project, the goal of the project was to create a minesweeper game, while working on Minesweeper I used html css, and js. this game was a little difficult to make at first because the algorithm for finding mines around the cells blew my brain a little, but I solved this issue with the help of recursion and after that, everything went like clockwork.
